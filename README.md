# Installation guide
This project supports installation with and without a web application. 
In the second case, to build the project, you also need to have dependencies that are specified for installation without a web application. 

## Installation (without web application)
* ### Ubuntu
  The following instructions were tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.
  #### Dependencies
  Prior to cloning the repository and attempting to build the project, ensure that you have the following software:

  - GNU g++ compiler, version 10+
  - CMake, version 3.13+
  - Boost library, version 1.72.0+

  #### Building the project
  Firstly, navigate to a desired directory.
  Then, clone the repository, cd into the project directory and launch the build script:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Mstrutov/Desbordante/
  cd Desbordante
  ./build.sh
  ```
  #### Launching the binaries
  The script generates the following file structure in `/path/to/Desbordante/build/target`:
  ```bash
  ├───inputData
  │   └───some-sample-csvs.csv
  ├───Desbordante_test
  ├───Desbordante_run
  ```
  The `inputData` directory contains several .csv files that may be used by `Desbordante_test`. Run `Desbordante_test` to perform unit testing:
  ```
  cd build/target
  ./Desbordante_test
  ```
  The tool itself is launched via the following line:
  ```
  ./Desbordante_run --algo=tane --data=<dataset_name>.csv
  ```

  The `<dataset_name>.csv`, which is a user-provided dataset, should be placed in the `/path/to/Desbordante/build/target` directory.

* ### Windows
  The following instructions were tested on Windows 10 .
  #### Dependencies
  Prior to cloning the repository and attempting to build the project, ensure that you have the following software:

  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
  - CMake, version 3.13+
  - Boost library, version 1.65.1+ \
    The recommended way to install Boost is by using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

  #### Building the project
  Firstly, launch the command prompt and navigate to a desired directory.
  Then, clone the repository, cd into the project directory and launch the build script:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Mstrutov/Desbordante/
  cd Desbordante
  git checkout windows-compatible
  build.bat
  ```
  *Note:* to compile the project, the script uses hard-coded path to MSVC developer command prompt, which is located
  by default at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat`.
  You should change the path in the script if it differs from the default one.
  #### Launching the binaries
  The script generates the following file structure in `\path\to\Desbordante\build\target`:
  ```bash
  ├───inputData
  │   └───some-sample-csv's.csv
  ├───Desbordante_test.exe
  ├───Desbordante_run.exe
  ```
  The `inputData` directory contains several .csv files that may be used by `Desbordante_test`. Run `Desbordante_test` to perform unit testing:
  ```
  cd build\target
  Desbordante_test.exe
  ```
  The tool itself is launched via the following line:
  ```
  Desbordante_run.exe --algo=tane --data=<dataset_name>.csv
  ```

  The `<dataset_name>.csv`, which is a user-provided dataset, should be placed in the `\path\to\Desbordante\build\target` directory.

## Installation (with web application)
Requires docker, docker-compose 
```
git clone https://github.com/vs9h/Desbordante.git
cd Desbordante/
git checkout origin/web-app
docker build -t cpp-consumer -f=Dockerfile-cpp-consumer .
mkdir -m777 volumes
cd volumes/
mkdir -m777 -p data/kafka data/zk logs/kafka logs/zk uploads postgres-data datasets
cd ..
unzip datasets/datasets.zip -d volumes/datasets/
cp tests/inputData/* volumes/datasets/
docker-compose build
```
## Configuring
1) Create .env file in Desbordante/
2) Set those variables:
  * POSTGRES_PASSWORD
  * POSTGRES_USER
  * POSTGRES_DB
  * KAFKA_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
  * CONSUMER_TL_SEC
  * CONSUMER_ML_MB

.env file format example:  
  VARIABLE_1=VALUE1  
  VARIABLE_2=VALUE2

## Running
```
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```
After the launch it will be available at http://localhost:3000/
